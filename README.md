# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-ML
A machine learning-based system for predicting lung cancer using patient lifestyle and medical parameters. Multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, SVC, and KNN were implemented and compared. A Flask web application was developed for deployment.
